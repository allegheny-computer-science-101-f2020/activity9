### Your team's assigned function

```
TODO: put the code of the function you experimented with
```

### Running time output from experiments

```
TODO: add at least 6 running times from experiments with different input sizes

Input size			Running time (in ms)
```

### Reflection

How can you describe the running time of this function (think back to primitive operations and big O notation)? What do you observe from your experiments?
